Now that you know about declarative UI programming and the difference between ephemeral and app state, you are ready to learn about simple app state management.

On this page, we are going to be using the provider package. If you are new to Flutter and you don’t have a strong reason to choose another approach (Redux, Rx, hooks, etc.), this is probably the approach you should start with. The provider package is easy to understand and it doesn’t use much code. It also uses concepts that are applicable in every other approach.

That said, if you have a strong background in state management from other reactive frameworks, you can find packages and tutorials listed on the options page
