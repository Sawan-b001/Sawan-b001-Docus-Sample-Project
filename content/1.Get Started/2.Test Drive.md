This page describes how to create a new Flutter app from templates, run it, and experience “hot reload” after you make changes to the app.

Select your development tool of choice for writing, building, and running Flutter apps.

##### VS code

## Create the app

::alert{type="info"}
:icon{name="material-symbols:warning"}

**Note:** When creating a new Flutter app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for a company domain name in reverse order, something like com.example. The company domain name and project name are used together as the package name for Android (the Bundle ID for iOS) when the app is released. If you think that the app might be released, it’s better to specify the package name now. The package name can’t be changed once the app is released, so make the name unique.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Note:** If VS Code was running during your initial Flutter setup, you might need to restart it for VS Code’s Flutter plugin to detect the Flutter SDK.
::

::alert{type="success"}
**Note:** The code for your app is in lib/main.dart. For a high-level description of what each code block does, see the comments at the top of that file.

## Run the app

1. Locate the VS Code status bar (the blue bar at the bottom of the window):

![terminalimage](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/device_status_bar.png) 2. Select a device from the Device Selector area. For details, see Quickly switching between Flutter devices.

::alert{type="warning"}
**Note:**
**Warning:** You might not see Start iOS Simulator option when you click No Devices in VS Code. If you’re on Mac, then you might have to run following command in terminal to launch a simulator.

#title

```js
    $ open -a simulator
```

On Windows or Linux, it’s not possible to launch an iOS simulator.

## Try hot reload

Flutter offers a fast development cycle with Stateful Hot Reload, the ability to reload the code of a live running app without restarting or losing app state. Make a change to app source, tell your IDE or command-line tool that you want to hot reload, and see the change in your simulator, emulator, or device.

1. Open lib/main.dart.
2. Change the string


::alert{type=""}
You have ~~pushed~~ the button this many times.
::
to
::alert{type=""}
You have ~~pushed~~ the button this many times.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Warninig :** Do not stop your app. Let your app run.
